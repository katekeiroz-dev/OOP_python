-- What is OOP:
A programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects.

-- ADVANTAGES OF OOP:
* Modularity:
 In object oriented programming, we define certain elements called classes that serve as blueprints.
These blueprints work like modules because they are sort of isolated or as isolated as possible from
the outside world.
This means that they are mostly independent from each other and from other parts of the program.
So that is a great advantage because any changes can be made easily to only that specific part of the
code without affecting the overall program.

* Extensibility:
A third advantage of object oriented programming is extensibility.
Objects can be extended to include new attributes and behaviors
We can add new attributes and behavior and extend their functionality.
These three advantages lead to the fourth advantage that object oriented programming makes your code
easier to maintain.


* Reusability :
Objects can be reused within the program and in future projects.
were independent from each other, we can select the ones that we need for a future project and reuse
their code.
This leads to faster development and lower cost of development because we save all the resources and
the time that it would take to write this code again.

___________
-- CLASS DEFINITION

The concept of a class is essential in object oriented programming.
It is an essential building block of any program written with object oriented programming.
So we can say that a class is like a blueprint that we write in our code to define the attributes or
characteristics of an object and its behavior.

And what is a class definition?
Well, a class definition is the actual implementation of a class in a programming language.
In this case, we are implementing it in Python.
Particularly the class header, is the first line of a class definition.
This line specifies the name of the class.
We explicitly write the name of the class and we also specify if the class inherits from another class.

-- class body
The class body contains the elements of the blueprint, the elements of the class.
This is where we define the attributes and the behavior of the objects.
So we're basically writing a description in the blueprint of what we want the objects to be like and
what they should be able to do.
These are the main elements that you will find in a class body.
Some classes may have all of these elements and some classes may only have some of these elements.
First we find the class attributes.
Then we find in it.
And finally we find the methods.
